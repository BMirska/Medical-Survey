# Before you start
You can download a ZIP file along with a CSV file ("Medical Survey"). Before using the app, you need to create a SharePoint list.

How to Set Up the SharePoint List:
- Select your desired SharePoint site.
- Click "Add new list" → "From existing CSV file".
- Choose the provided CSV file.
- This will automatically create all the necessary columns for you, making the list ready for integration with the app.

- Connecting the App to SharePoint:
- The app uses Environmental Variables for SharePoint connections.
- When launching the app, you will be prompted to select your own SharePoint list.
Enjoy using the Medical Survey app! 🚀
# Medical-Survey
The Medical Survey is a Power Platform application built with Power Apps, connected to a SharePoint list to streamline patient survey management and data collection.

This README provides an overview of the app’s features and functionality.
## Features
The Medical Survey App consists of multiple screens that provide a comprehensive survey management solution.

This demo version represents a simplified application, whereas the original solution is part of a broader system connecting multiple survey apps within a medical hospital.

With this app, users can:
✅ Add new surveys for patients
✅ Manage already completed surveys
✅ Prevent duplicate entries and redirect users to the editing section

#### 🟢 Loading Screen:
- Loads all essential app styles as global variables (OnVisible property).
- A timer ensures that all global variables are properly loaded before navigating to the Home Screen.

#### 🏠  Screen 1 'Home Screen':
- Central navigation panel → Allows users to select the survey type. In this demo, only the "Health Habits" survey is available.
- Left navigation panel → Navigate to "Complete Another Survey" (in the full version: access different applications and visits). Directly access "View and Edit Surveys" for managing existing surveys.
- Right panel → Displays real-time statistics: Number of registered patients (= Number of completed surveys).

#### 👤 Screen I Basic
- Users register a new patient by entering Patient Name and Patient ID (both required). If the Patient ID does not exist in SharePoint → The user can proceed. If the Patient ID already exists → The user cannot proceed and sees a message: "The survey for this patient has already been completed! Please go to the 'Review and Edit Surveys' tab."
- Upon clicking "→" (Next button):
- The Patient ID is stored as a global variable for use in the next screens.
- A progress indicator at the bottom shows how many steps remain.

#### ❌ User Can Cancel the Survey at Any Step
- Clicking the "X" button redirects to a confirmation screen: "Returning to the main screen will result in data loss. Do you want to cancel the survey?"

#### Screen Edit and View Surveys
- If a survey already exists for a patient, the user can edit the form here.
- Left panel (Gallery) → Displays all existing surveys with a search function (by Patient Name or ID).
- Right panel → Shows survey responses for the selected patient.
- Top section → Users can Edit, Submit changes, or Navigate to the Home Screen.
When a user submits an edit, the app updates the SharePoint list with:
✅ The edited answers

✅ The modification date
